  <h3 class="crt-green mt-2">Faces of Death // Cycle Note</h3>
  <p>Assigned another task. These are the jobs I do for free. I call them: faces of death.</p>
  <p>Someone deleted from the mainframe of the universe. One moment: 1. Next moment: 0.</p>
  <p>My duty: compress their existence into a 4GB / 30min / 1080p data capsule. Snaps. Snips. Binary fragments of a human life.</p>

  <div class="video-container mt-2">
    <video controls poster="/assets/img/Beach.jpg" title="It's a beach">

  <p class="mt-2">I’ve seen the decay: Faded bumper stickers where years blur into static. Sun-wrinkled inkjet memorials, writhing into oil stains on paper. Phone screenshots. Scanned negatives with bad filters.</p>
  <p>Why filters? Why distort the raw? Sometimes I just wish people shot truth, no masks, no edits.</p>
  <p>Yesterday I walked the beach. Stared out at nothing. Unplugged. Breathed. But cycles don’t stop. Code won’t write itself. Corp demands continue.</p>
  <p>Maybe one day an AI will read these logs in my voice, answer the question I keep circling: What’s next?</p>
