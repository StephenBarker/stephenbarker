    <p>I spent the first day of the year the way I always do,watching twenty-four unskippable ads on friends’ memorial pages. Why waste the crypto when even death can be ad-supported and AI-enhanced?</p>

    <p>We didn’t pay for the famous mourners. No one you’d recognize, but that’s the point. Or at least it plays well as a public post. Did they really know that many people? No. But the Corporation® will give you the day off if you knew them. <br>
    Three days if you were “biological.”</p>

    <p>That always struck me as strange.</p>

    <p>My father was analog.<br>
    My mother was a leaking capacitor. You know the kind. The display works fine for a while, then the <pre class="glitch mt-2" style="margin-top: 0px;">voltage drops: fuzz, glitch, normal.</pre> The cycle repeats.</p>

    <p>Then there are people who aren’t blood, but you just get them.<br>
    Like <code>SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK</code>.<br>
    TCP.<br>
    Totally connected person.</p>

    <p>I could write a script to auto-play the ads.<br>
    But I watch them.</p>

    <p>Yes, antidepressants would be lovely!<br>
    Sure... Let me ask my Corp® provided, in-network family doctor. (Specialist will need prior-auth)<br><br>
    Here’s an overpriced photo we can print for you.
    (It will collect dust.)<br><br>
    Would you like a chronological GPS map of everywhere your father went in his life?<br>
    If it wasn’t documented, we can generate it for you.
    It’s simple with our OSENTai™.</p>

    <p>No.</p>

    <p>I don’t want to pay with real-time eyeballs,<br>
    nor with skimmed crypto earned elsewhere.</p>

    <p>It feels… wrong. Not guilt. Not shame. More like obligation.</p>

    <p>Like a protocol I didn’t agree to, but keep responding to anyway.</p>

    <p>Maybe that’s the real virus. The inability to articulate what is wrong so I just go with it.</p>
