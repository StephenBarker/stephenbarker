  <p>A thought. A whisper. An idea that I won't let go.</p>
  <p>My body stands on a possibility in the void: do I keep stacking the house of cards, juggling threads, patching holes-or do I tear it all down to the atoms of its DNA and build clean?</p>
  <p>Because patches become legacy. And in legacy code, dragons wait. Last week, it was a single malformed CSV from HR that nearly took down the finance mainframe. One wrong move and the whole edifice collapses. We're running on borrowed time and duct tape.</p>
  <p>Cycles ago, I asked for Python to be our lingua franca. <p class="glitch">Denied.</p> Corp decreed PowerShell, not from strength, but ignorance-no one could code, and brain upgrades werenâ€™t on the menu. But the dark days pass. New programmers awaken. With them comes the ability to learn, grow, and build something that lasts.</p>
  <p>Now, the plan: build an in-house Data Warehouse and Master Data Management (MDM) system. Our feeds-ERP, Active Directory, the shadow fleet of tertiary apps-are all fractured shards across the domain.</p>
  <pre class="glitch">
> connect-source --name ERP.PROD ... [FAILED: TIMEOUT]
> connect-source --name AD.CORP ... [OK]
> connect-source --name APP.SHADOW.03 ... [FAILED: AUTH_DENIED]
> connect-source --name CtrlAltCorp.Dev ... [Always GOOD]
  </pre>
  <p>The goal is to unify them. Design the ETL. Shape the pipelines. Build a self-service portal so exports stop being a nightmare of glue and blind faith. So data becomes whole again.</p>
  <p>This isn't just about clean code. It's about building a better machine-one that serves the user, not the bureaucracy. One that I control.</p>
  <p>So I can finally kill the ritual of stitching five systems together just to get a single file out.</p>
  <p>A new foundation. A new cycle.</p>
  <p class="glitch mt-2">This is how you reboot the corp.</p>
