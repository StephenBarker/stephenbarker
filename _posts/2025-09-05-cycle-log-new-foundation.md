  <p>A thought. A whisper. An idea that I won't let go.</p>
  <p>My body stands on a possibility in the void: do I keep stacking the house of cards, juggling threads, patching holes-or do I tear it all down to the atoms of its DNA and build clean?</p>
  <p>Because patches become legacy. And in legacy code, dragons wait. Last week, it was a single malformed CSV from HR that nearly took down the finance mainframe. One wrong move and the whole edifice collapses. We're running on borrowed time and duct tape.</p>
  <p>Cycles ago, I asked for Python to be our lingua franca. <span class="glitch">Denied.</span> Corp® decreed PowerShell, not from strength, but ignorance-no one could code, and brain upgrades weren’t on the menu. But the dark days pass. New programmers awaken. With them comes the ability to learn, grow, and build something that lasts.</p>
  <p>Now, the plan: build an in-house Data Warehouse and Master Data Management (MDM) system. Our feeds-ERP, Active Directory, the shadow fleet of tertiary apps-are all fractured shards across the domain.</p>
  <pre class="glitch">
> connect-source --name ERP.PROD ... [FAILED: TIMEOUT]
> connect-source --name AD.CORP® ... [OK]
> connect-source --name APP.SHADOW.03 ... [FAILED: AUTH_DENIED]
> connect-source --name CtrlAltCorp.Dev ... [Always GOOD]
  </pre>
  <p>The goal is to unify them. Design the ETL. Shape the pipelines. Build a self-service portal so exports stop being a nightmare of glue and blind faith. So data becomes whole again.</p>
  <p>This isn't just about clean code. It's about building a better machine-one that serves the user, not the bureaucracy. One that I control.</p>
  <p>So I can finally kill the ritual of stitching five systems together just to get a single file out.</p>
  <p>A new foundation. A new cycle.</p>
  <p class="glitch mt-2">This is how you reboot the Corp®.</p>
