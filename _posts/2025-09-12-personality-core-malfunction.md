  <h3 class="crt-green mt-2">&gt;&gt; ERROR LOG 0x01: PERSONALITY CORE MALFUNCTION</h3>
  <p>Not skills issues—those are solvable. Skills I can teach. We can dual-boot the brain, debug together, grow the codebase.</p>
  <p>But personality issues? That’s a different virus. Rage when the machine does exactly what it was told. Smash keyboard, slam mouse, storm out. Other devs avoid them like corrupted sectors—because every interaction leads to pain or tears.</p>

  <h3 class="crt-green mt-2">&gt;&gt; ERROR LOG 0x02: VIRAL BEHAVIOR DETECTED</h3>
  <p>Symptoms:</p>
  <ul class="list--custom">
    <li>Isolation in silo.</li>
    <li>Sandbox locked, guarded by screams.</li>
    <li class="glitch crt-magenta">WARNING: DOES NOT PLAY WELL WITH OTHERS.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Legacy artist calcified into fossil. Management directive: “VBS is deprecated—migrate to C#.” Response: MORE VBS. Debt climbs. Corp sinks deeper into legacy quicksand.</p>

  <h3 class="crt-green mt-2">&gt;&gt; ERROR LOG 0x03: WALL OF NO</h3>
  <p>“Can you fix the workflow to update records?” → NO.<br>“Add data validation to stop null refs?” → NO.<br>“Migrate stack from 1990s → 2010?” → NO.</p>
  <p>Not “can’t.” Won’t. Refusal to evolve. Dead weight sanctified.</p>

  <h3 class="crt-green mt-2">&gt;&gt; ERROR LOG 0x04: SYSTEM INSTABILITY</h3>
  <p>Job paradox: Fun work. Meaningful code. Toxic variable. Management refuses deletion. Corp won’t fire. Runtime drifts toward crash.</p>

  <p class="crt-green mt-2">&gt;&gt; END OF TRANSMISSION<br>&gt;&gt; STATUS: <span class="glitch crt-magenta">UNRESOLVED</span></p>
